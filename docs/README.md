### Weather Library For Developers

Welcome, this library was developed in order to help C# developers easily retrieve weather data from different places around the world. 

The web service currently being used is: [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/)

The project was initially developed in the Programming Languages course instructed by [Mr. Haim Michael](http://lifemichael.com/moodle/) and is open for extensions.
